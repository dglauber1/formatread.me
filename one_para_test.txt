There was so   much to read for one thing and so much fine health to 
be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking 
and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like 
new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas 
and Morgan and Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other 
books besides. I was rather literary in college--one year I wrote a series of very 
solemn and obvious editorials for the "Yale News"--and now I was going to bring back 
all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists,
the "well-rounded man." This isn\'t just an epigram--life is much more successfully 
looked at from a single window, after all.
